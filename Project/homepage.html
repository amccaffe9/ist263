    <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Bulldogs have a long history and even date back to 5th century England, and they were bred with 
            aggressive traits to help with livestock. Eventually the aggressiveness of the bulldogs led to entertainment 
            and the “bull” name of the dogs, as they were baited against a bull and would attack the bull’s nose until it 
            had pulled the bull ot the ground or the bull killed the dog. </p>
