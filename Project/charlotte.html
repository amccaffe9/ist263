<div><p>When I was in eighth grade we had two dogs, Joey and Chase. We decided we needed another dog and my
    brother really was a proponent for a bulldog because of what he had seen online. After an hour long trip to
    Pennsylvania, our parents surprised us and we got to choose a puppy from a litter. The dogs name was 
    Scarlett, and we changed her name to Charlotte.</p></div>
<div><p>Currently Charlotte is six years old and loves to take naps and go on walks. She sometimes sleeps upside 
    down on her back and will snore really loudly. Like Bentley and Finn, she is an obnoxious younger sister to 
    her older senior brother Chase and is an attention hog, but she is also really sweet and loves her brother.
    Charlotte inspired our love for bulldogs as a family and why we follow other social media accounts of 
    bulldogs. Since getting her, we did get another bulldog puppy Finn, but Charlotte and Finn did not get 
    along so we had to get rid of Finn and send him to a different home.</p></div>
