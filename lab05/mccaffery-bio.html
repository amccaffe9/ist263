            My name is Adam McCaffery. I am a <strong> Public Relations and Information Management & Technology </strong> major who is interested in media and tech related to sports. A skill I have is writing for the Daily Orange and I have written over 100 articles! Outside of work I love to watch sports and have two dogs, Chase and Charlotte. I'm excited to learn to code this year!
