    <h3>Chowder the Bulldog</h3>

    <p> Chowder is a bulldog famous on TikTok and Instagram and rose to his fame because of his ability to 
        skateboard which is uncommon for a dog. His Instagram consists of him zooming down hills and heâ€™s 
        always eager to skate, which goes against the notion that bulldogs can skate.
        He collaborates with plenty of other bulldogs and tries skating like related things such as snowboarding. 
        Many of his viewers always ask how he stops because he goes fast down hills and the video always stops 
        but he manages to slow himself down using his other two legs.</p>

    <p>Handsome Dan is the University of Yale's mascot and currently has about 40,000 followers on Instagram. 
        He gets to walk around campus and is trained to go to games and support his athletic teams. He is an 
        American Bulldog and is roughly two years old, and took the reins of Handsome Dan during COVID in 2020.
        Handsome Dan is most popular among the sports teams when he goes to the games and gets a lot of pets 
        from every team for supporting them.</p>

    <p>Like Handsome Dan, Butler Blue is a mascot but for Butler University instead. Blue has 54 thousand 
        followers on Instagram and got a lot of notoriety after the changing of the collar ceremony at a basketball 
        game taking over his Uncle Trip's role as the mascot. </p>

    <p> Theo loves his bowls. Sometimes, dogs develop specific obsessions with certain toys and this dog happened to develop them for bowls. It brings out the most energy in him. When the owners open the dishwasher, he will do running to get the clean bowls and play with them. Maybe there's a reason they're called bowl-dogs (haha).  </p>
